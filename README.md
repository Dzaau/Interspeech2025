# File descriptions

1. **`GCIDetectionForEGG.mlx`**  
    A MATLAB (R2023a) function developed by the first author to detect Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) in Electroglottography (EGG) signals. Includes interactive examples and visualizations. The Signal Processing Toolbox and Wavelet Toolbox are needed to run the function successfully.
    
2. **Sample Wave Files (`*.wav`)**  
    Four speech/EGG recordings representing _checked_ and _unchecked_ tokens. You may use these to validate the GCI detection function.
    
3. **`ZhaoInterspeech2025.RData`**  
    The dataset containing all variables used for statistical analysis in the study.
    
4. **`ZhaoInterspeech2025.Rmd`**  
    R Markdown script that fully reproduces the statistical analyses, visualizations, and results reported in the paper. Executing this generates:
    
5. **`ZhaoInterspeech2025.html`**  
    Final rendered report detailing all data processing workflows, statistical models (including formulas and diagnostics), results, and figures referenced in the manuscript.
